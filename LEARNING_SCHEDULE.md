2. **Join Communities:** Don't learn in isolation - join Discord servers and ask questions
3. **Build in Public:** Share your progress on Twitter/LinkedIn
4. **Use Testnets:** Always test thoroughly on testnets before mainnet
5. **Security First:** Every feature should be built with security in mind
6. **Document Everything:** Your future self will thank you
7. **Fail Fast:** Make mistakes early and learn from them
